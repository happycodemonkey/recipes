  This recipe was adapted from a casserole originally made by my partner's
  mother. It started from some notes scribbled on an index card, and through
  experimentation became sometihng of a chunky vegetable pasta bake with sausage.

  Legend has it that the 'surprise' in Italian Surpise is that it's not even the
  least bit Italian.

ingredients:
  - (1 lb) Mild Italian Sausage (or ground pork)
  - 1 Large Yellow Onion
  - 4 cloves Garlic
  - 1 Large Bell Pepper (any color)
  - (8 oz) Crimini Mushrooms

  - (1/2 cup) Corn (from can or frozen)

  - (6 oz) Tomato Paste
  - (1 Cup) Wine

  - When pasta is cooked drain and place into a large bowl.
  - Add the sauce, sausage, and corn to the bowl and mix thoroughly.
  - Place the mixture in a 13" x 9" baking dish. you may have enough leftover to fill a second small baking dish.
  - Cover with a generous sprinkle of parmesan and a thick top layer of mozzarella.
  - Gently cover the pan(s) with aluminum foil, being careful to keep the foil from touching the cheese.
  - Bake for 30 minutes until the cheese is melted.
  - Remove foil and bake for another 5-10 minutes until the top is browned.
  - Remove from the oven and let cool for 10-15 mintues before eating so you don't burn yourself.
